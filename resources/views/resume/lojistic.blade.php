            As Senior Codemaster at Lojistic I lead a team of 6 (very talented)
            creative professionals, manage several vendors, develop high-priority
            software &amp; marketing assets, and guide the organization's tech related decisions.

        <p>
            My main focus is driving the marketing and development efforts for our website,
            free tools, and our custom client management system. I also train and guide less
            experienced developers to ensure code quality and consistency.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the week I screen and interview developers and designers who apply to join
            our team, and work with 3rd party development teams to help define the functionality and
            design of more self-contained projects.
