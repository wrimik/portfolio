            At HCWI I transitioned from a graphic designer to a web developer.
            I designed and developed dozens of websites with a small
            development team and worked with clients to create unique brands
            that reflected the personality of each company and its owners.

            When I was put in charge of website development, I helped the team
            to adopt some of the emerging standards of the time, including
            div based layouts and external stylesheets.
