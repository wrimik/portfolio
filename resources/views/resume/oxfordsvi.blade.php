            As an Interactive Media Producer I helped create menu systems for
            video-on-demand services in hotel rooms, as well as video
            editing and print design.

            In order to streamline the sales demo process, I created a Flash based
            copy of our movie ordering system (this was back when Flash was cool).
            Before this was created, each sales rep was
            assinged their own portable video server and had to wait for the engineering
            team to run updates before every demonstration.

            My system reduced the amount of time needed to set up a branded demo, and it
            let the sales reps travel with a single cd, rather than a server the size of
            a full desktop computer.
