    <p>
        At HCWI I transitioned from a graphic designer to a web developer.
        I designed and developed dozens of websites with a small
        development team and worked with clients to create unique brands
        that reflected the personality of each company and its owners.

        As an aside, this is my favorite part of my portfolio. These sites
        were created at a strange time in internet history, and as a result,
        they look very... <i>2007</i>.
