    <p>
        As Senior Codemaster at Lojistic I lead a team of 6 (very talented)
        creative professionals, manage several vendors, develop high-priority
        software and marketing assets, and guide the organizations tech related decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main focus is driving the marketing and development efforts for our website,
        free tools, and our custom client management system. I also train and guide less
        experienced developers to ensure code quality and consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the week I screen and interview developers and designers who apply to join
        our team, and work with 3rd party development teams to help define the functionality and
        design of more self-contained projects.
