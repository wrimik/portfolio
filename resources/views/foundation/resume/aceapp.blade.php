        Aceapp provided me an opportunity to grow in a lot of ways. My mentorship under the wing
        of the company's ceo helped me get an understanding of the principals
        of user experience, project management, design, team management, and marketing.

    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <h5>Beevio</h5>

    <p>
        Aceapp's flagship product, Bugbase, was a monthly subscription software for pest control companies.
        It was written in a programming language called 'Open Insight' which, like Navajo, only 3 people
        actualy know - and they don't talk to eachother. This platform wasn't built for the web, and clients
        were starting to demand features that could only be acheived with a web based solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recreating the funcitonality of Bugbase into our new product, Beevio,
        took about 2 years form start to launch. As a part of this rewrite,
        we automated both our signup process and monthly billing. My team and I built Beevio using
        cutting edge (at the time) Object Oriented PHP, responsive web pages, dynamic CSS, a custom
        SVG editor for creating floor plans, click and drag schduling (like google calendar) and
        this hot new thing called <i>Ajax</i>.
